              "I went on holidays in South-Africa. having bought a bunch of tropical
              stuff to support my journey I did not know what to do with them on my return
              to England. I listed them here some to give away some to sell. I was delighted to 
              return home a few KGs lighter which I used to pack some souvenirs from my holidays.
